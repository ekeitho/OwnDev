I took on this coding challenge at -->
https://www.mindsumo.com/contests/relaunched-use-population-data-to-identify-promising-markets


I took the downloaded Metropolitan Population csv file 
and renamed it to 'metro.csv' for my python script. 


I compared my answers with: http://tpr.org/post/san-marcos-rate-population-growtâ€‹h-leads-nation-why-its-booming. 
The website contains two census population pictures, in which my solution matches perfectly with 2011 to 2012 results.

The output that was required was from 2010-2012, however I also 
calculated population growth rates from 2010-2011, 2011-2012, and numeric population growth rate or what I called "weightedRate".
