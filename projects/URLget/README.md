The point for this project is that url's contain information.

www.ekeitho.com ? tag = hi

With URLS the first part before the ? is the domain name and after it is called query.
The ? acts as a seperator between the two.

The query is what I am interested. The = seperates 'tag' (the field) and 'hi' (the value).
In this project I wanted to created a class that implements a URL and to get the values from a query.

A query is useful to the webpage, since it has been taken from the HTTP client, to tell how the webpage should work/look.
Being able to get the query's value, will allow modifications to the page, such as clicking a button 
that changes the look of a field's aspect in real time.

Built in Java, Javascript, Python, and C.
