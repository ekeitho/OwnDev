I started off doing this project for my Tech Writing 149 class.
We had to do an extra project, to prove to our teacher we want an A in the class.
So, I decided to transform my resume into a functional website.

Throught the course I learned much about Discourse and constructing my view through my own industry, the tech industry.
I wanted to be able to create this website to show recruiters what I made in my free time.
This will demonstrate that I am not a pretender in their Discourse and I will do anything it takes to succeed.

I have linked my Github to the "WORK" tab and linked my LinkedIn to the "ABOUT ME" tab.
I will not have links to any social site such as Instagram or Facebook, because I feel that defeats the purpose for why I created this website. 
I am trying to make this as professional as I can, because this is what recruiters or anybody who is interested in me, will see.

PS. I am very proud to say that I created my own version of an "accordion" using JQuery.
Thanks for checking it out!
